## RLHF Case Studies Using A Sociological Framework  
Jeremy Hein  
PhD Sociologist | AI Alignment and Evaluation Specialist | 

## Overview
This repository showcases my applied work in AI training and alignment, building on three decades of research and teaching. Since 2025, I have contributed as a researcher and practitioner to RLHF projects at Snorkel AI, Outlier AI, and Handshake AI — designing edge-case prompts, evaluating model reasoning, and applying inclusive pedagogy to improve large language models (LLMs). My approach to human-centered AI integrates symbolic interaction theory with the perspectives of neurodiverse learners.

## Contents
- Case studies demonstrating RLHF principles in support of autistic and neurodiverse learners  
- Rubric-based feedback generators that simulate empathetic instructional responses  
- Prompt design experiments informed by sociology, pedagogy, and cultural analysis  

## Why It Matters
This work explores how large language models can be trained and evaluated using humanistic rubrics — especially in emotionally complex or educational contexts. By centering learner-generated schemas and inclusive pedagogy, it contributes to broader conversations around AI alignment, inclusive instruction, and symbolic reasoning in LLMs.
