# RLHF Case Studies Using a Sociological Framework  
**Jeremy Hein, PhD**  
AI Alignment & Evaluation Specialist  

## Overview  
This repo highlights my applied work in **reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)** and AI alignment. I design stump prompts, evaluate reasoning failures, and apply inclusive pedagogy to improve large language models (LLMs). My approach combines **sociological methods** with practical experience supporting neurodiverse learners.  

## Contents  
- Case studies in RLHF for inclusive learning  
- Rubric‑based feedback generators  
- Prompt design experiments on bias, fairness, and cross‑cultural reasoning  

## Why It Matters  
AI systems need human‑centered evaluation. My work shows how **sociological methods and conceptual frameworks** can strengthen fairness, interpretability, and alignment in emotionally complex or educational contexts.  

## Credentials  
- PhD in Sociology, Northwestern University (NSF‑funded)  
- Professor of Sociology, UW–Eau Claire (1989–2017)  
- RLHF contributor: Snorkel AI, Outlier AI, Handshake AI  
- 30+ peer‑reviewed publications, 1,500+ citations  
- Certificates in Generative AI & Prompt Engineering
