# RLHF Case Studies for Neurodiverse Education  
Dr. Jeremy Hein  
PhD Sociologist | AI Trainer | Educator  

## Welcome  
I bring 30+ years of sociological expertise into AI training and alignment. Since 2025, I’ve contributed to projects at Snorkel AI, Outlier AI, and Handshake AI — crafting edge-case prompts, evaluating model reasoning, and applying inclusive pedagogy to improve large language models (LLMs). This repository showcases my work at the intersection of RLHF, symbolic interactionism, and neurodiverse education.

## What You'll Find Here  
- Case studies applying RLHF principles to support autistic and neurodiverse learners  
- Rubric-based feedback generators designed to simulate empathetic AI responses  
- Prompt design experiments grounded in sociology, comparative religion, and pedagogy  
- Reflections on alignment from a human-centered perspective  

## Why This Matters  
This project explores how AI systems can be trained and evaluated using humanistic rubrics — especially in emotionally complex or educational contexts. It aims to contribute to the broader conversation around AI alignment, inclusive instruction, and symbolic reasoning in LLMs.

## Background & Credentials  
- NSF-funded PhD from Northwestern University  
- 1,500+ citations on Google Scholar
