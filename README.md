## RLHF Case Studies Using A Sociological Framework  
Dr. Jeremy Hein  
PhD Sociologist | AI Trainer | Educator

## Overview  
This repository showcases my applied work in AI training and alignment, drawing on 30+ years of sociological expertise. Since 2025, I’ve contributed to RLHF projects at Snorkel AI, Outlier AI, and Handshake AI — designing edge-case prompts, evaluating model reasoning, and applying inclusive pedagogy to improve large language models (LLMs). My approach integrates symbolic interactionism, comparative religion, and musicology to support neurodiverse learners and human-centered AI development.

## Contents  
- Case studies applying RLHF principles to support autistic and neurodiverse learners  
- Rubric-based feedback generators simulating empathetic instructional responses  
- Prompt design experiments grounded in sociology, pedagogy, and cultural analysis  
- Reflections on alignment from a humanities-informed perspective

## Why It Matters  
This work explores how AI systems can be trained and evaluated using humanistic rubrics — especially in emotionally complex or educational contexts. It contributes to broader conversations around AI alignment, inclusive instruction, and symbolic reasoning in LLMs.
