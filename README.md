# Using Sociological Frameworks for Human-Centered AI  
**Jeremy Hein, PhD**  
AI Alignment & Evaluation Specialist  

## Overview  
This repository showcases applied work in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and AI alignment through a sociological lens. I design stump prompts, identify reasoning failures, and apply inclusive pedagogy to improve large language models (LLMs). My approach integrates sociological methods with practical experience supporting neurodiverse learners, creating human‑centered evaluation frameworks.
 

## Contents  
- Case studies in RLHF for inclusive learning  
- Rubric‑based feedback generators  
- Prompt design experiments on bias, fairness, and cross‑cultural reasoning
- Conceptual benchmarks (e.g., The Freddie Test, Persona Prompt Paradox)
  

## Why It Matters  
AI systems require human‑centered evaluation to ensure fairness, interpretability, and alignment. My work demonstrates how sociological frameworks—from symbolic interaction theory to cross‑cultural analysis—can strengthen AI performance in emotionally complex and educational contexts.
