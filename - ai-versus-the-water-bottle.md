# “My Water Bottle Scared Me”

## TL;DR

Freddie, a fourth-grade student with severe autism, found comfort in algebra and fear in loud noises. This case study explores how emotionally intelligent AI — designed to detect sensory triggers and respond with personalized support — could help neurodivergent students like Freddie thrive. As Andrew Ng says, “AI is task replacement, not job replacement” — and special ed paraprofessionals like me need all the help we can get.

I met Freddie when he was in fourth grade and quickly observed that he loved real math — not multiplication or fractions, but algebra. When he felt stressed in class, which was very often, he’d ask his teacher if he could take a break in Jenny's small office across the hall. She was the special education case manager and my supervisor. Once inside, he’d walk straight to the whiteboard and start solving equations for *x* and *y*. No one told him to. Jenny and I knew he just needed the relief of feeling he was part of a system with known rules and procedures — something predictable, logical, and reliable.

Freddie always wore headphones — lunch, recess, gym, art — because he had severe Autism Spectrum Disorder and he was frightened by loud noises. A BANG or CRASH that most people could ignore were like a banshee wailing in his ear. And that is why he wore noise-cancelling headphones all through the day, every day.

One afternoon in the middle of the school year, he raced out of his classroom in tears and banged on Jenny's door. When she opened the door and asked what was the matter, Freddie said:

“My water bottle scared me.”

It was one of those big, heavy metal bottles. A student had walked by Freddie's desk and accidentally knocked it off. The clang was sharp, sudden, and overwhelming. Freddie wasn’t just startled — he was terrified. The sound overloaded his senses and overwhelmed his ability to rationally evaluate what had just happened. But once we calmed him down — once the world felt reliable again — he picked up a marker and returned to the board. He started solving equations. 

Unfortunately, these incidents happened almost daily — distracting other students, adding stress for his teacher, interrupting groupss of students already in Jenny's office, and deepening Freddie’s own anxiety. On days when there was a subtitute teacher or Jenny was in a meeting, Freddie's challenges became even more severe.

## AI for Freddie

In **headphones designed with emotionally intelligent AI**, this Water Bottle moment wouldn’t be lost. The system would:

- **Detect the loud noise**, and recognize it as a potential sensory trigger.
- **Reference teacher-designed rubrics** — structured guides that outline how to respond to specific events like sensory overload.
- **Consult teacher notes** — daily logs that document what worked, what didn’t, and how Freddie responded.
- **Select the right support strategy** — maybe offering calming input, suggesting a break, or redirecting him to math, his reliable space.

At the end of the day, the teacher would score the effectiveness of each intervention. The AI would learn from that feedback — not just what happened, but what helped. Over time, it would become a quiet companion, attuned to Freddie’s rhythms, ready to support without overwhelming. 

Fewer disruptions to Freddie's day would really benefit him, his classmates, teacher, case manager, and me--a special education paraprofessional who had to juggle the needs of Freddie and several other students all at the same time. As Andrew Ng reminds us, "AI is task replacement, not job replacement."
