# “My Water Bottle Scared Me”

I met Freddie when he was in fourth grade and quickly observed that he loved real math — not multiplication or fractions, but algebra. When he felt stressed in class, which was very often, he’d ask his teacher if he could take a break in Jenny's small office across the hall. She was the special education case manager and my supervisor. Sometimes Freddie would just flee from his classroom without asking permission and bang on Jenny's door. Once inside, he’d walk straight to the whiteboard and start solving equations for *x* and *y*. No one told him to. Jenny and I knew he just needed the relief of feeling he was part of a system with known rules and procedures — something predictable, logical, and reliable.

Freddie always wore headphones — lunch, recess, gym, art — because he was so frightened by loud noises. Loud sounds that most people could ignore were like a banshee wailing in his ear.
One afternoon, he raced out of his classroom in tears and banged on the door of the case manager’s office. When she opened the door and asked what was the matter, Freddie said:

> “My water bottle scared me.”

It was one of those big, heavy metal bottles. A student had walked by and accidentally knocked it off his desk. The clang was sharp, sudden, and overwhelming. Freddie wasn’t just startled — he was undone. The sound overwhelmed him, and he couldn’t absorb the shock.

But once he calmed down — once the world felt reliable again — he picked up a marker and returned to the board. He started solving equations. He was only nine years old, **and he had severe Autism Spectrum Disorder. These incidents happened daily — distracting other students, adding stress for his teacher, and deepening Freddie’s own anxiety. And that is why he wore noise-cancelling headphones all through the day, every day.**

## AI for Freddie

In **headphones designed with emotionally intelligent AI**, that moment wouldn’t be lost. The system would:

- **Detect the loud noise**, and recognize it as a potential sensory trigger.
- **Reference teacher-designed rubrics** — structured guides that outline how to respond to specific events like sensory overload.
- **Consult teacher notes** — daily logs that document what worked, what didn’t, and how Freddie responded.
- **Select the right support strategy** — maybe offering calming input, suggesting a break, or redirecting him to math, his reliable space.

At the end of the day, the teacher would score the effectiveness of each intervention. The AI would learn from that feedback — not just what happened, but what helped. Over time, it would become a quiet companion, attuned to Freddie’s rhythms, ready to support without overwhelming.
