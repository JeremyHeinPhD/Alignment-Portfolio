# AI and Neurodiverse Students

Neurodiverse students include those on the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or with emotional-behavioral disorders.

Autism is a communication disorder, usually exhibited as an inability to engage in spontaneous, turn-taking speech with another person. In extreme cases, a student with autism may engage in **scripting** — repeating a phrase over and over, such as a line from a song or a TV commercial. This behavior is obsessive, and the student may react with hostility if interrupted.

An emotional-behavioral disorder is often characterized by extremes of sadness or anger. The student has difficulty maintaining a middle-ground emotional state. When sad, the student may curl up on the floor and ask, _“Am I a bad person?”_ When angry, the student may engage in physical aggression and yelling.

I worked as a special education paraprofessional with this student population in elementary schools in Washington County, MN, for four years. I learned many techniques for helping students when they became **dysregulated** — caught in a negative emotional loop and unable to realistically interpret the impact of their emotions and behavior.

Examples of dysregulation include pushing assigned work off the desk, breaking a pencil as a sign of refusal, or leaving the classroom without permission.

### Daily Use of Headphones and Emotional Support

Each student had their own pair of noise-canceling headphones — they were not shared. These headphones were considered part of the student’s personal regulation toolkit. If a student broke or lost the pair provided by the school, parents were often asked to purchase a replacement to ensure continuity of support.

As a paraprofessional, I carried the student’s headphones with me throughout the school day, including during recess, transitions, and other unstructured times. These moments were often the most emotionally volatile, and having the headphones nearby provided a sense of safety and consistency. The students knew I had their headphones and that I was ready to help them regulate when needed.

An AI assistant embedded in such a device would need to function in noisy, unpredictable environments and offer support beyond the classroom — during recess, in hallways, or even on the bus. It would need to be mobile, discreet, and emotionally attuned to the student’s needs throughout the day.

### Breaks, Rewards, and AI-Driven Motivation

As part of my role, I was allowed to use the student’s personal Chromebook or iPad to offer breaks and rewards. These included educational games, non-educational games, short commercial videos, music, and drawing or art apps. Many students enjoyed creating digital art as a calming activity or as a reward for completing work. These tools were not just distractions; they were strategic supports that helped students regulate, reset, and re-engage with their tasks.

I learned to offer these options at the right moment — after a task was completed, or when a student was on the verge of dysregulation and needed a calming break. An AI model could easily adopt this motivational strategy. For example, it could ask:
- _“What type of music would help you calm down?”_
- _“Would you like to draw for five minutes before we start the next activity?”_
- _“Will you complete the work if I let you watch coming attractions for Sonic the Hedgehog for two minutes?”_

These kinds of prompts mirror the real-world negotiations I had with students — respectful, personalized, and emotionally attuned. They could be delivered through a voice assistant or embedded in a wearable device, helping students feel heard and supported while staying on track.

### Handling Big Emotions: A Scripted Intervention

One well-known technique for helping a student become regulated is called **Handling Big Emotions**. It uses a five-step script that an AI model could easily follow, just like a paraprofessional:

1. _“It seems like you are feeling upset.”_  
2. _“Are you feeling sad/angry/frustrated/scared?”_  
3. _“Are you feeling frustrated because… [e.g., ‘there is too much work’]”_  
4. _“Would you feel less frustrated if I crossed off some questions so you only have to do one?”_  
5. _“What else can I do to help you feel less frustrated?”_

Many neurodiverse students wear noise-canceling headphones. An AI model embedded in headphones could deliver this script and respond appropriately — offering calm, consistent support in moments of emotional need.

### Personalized AI Model per Student

Each student’s noise-canceling headphones are paired with a personalized AI model — similar to a chatbot — that remembers past conversations and adapts its responses over time. These models are designed to support emotional regulation, motivation, and engagement based on the student’s unique preferences and behavioral patterns.

### AI Integration with Chromebook or iPad

Each student’s personalized AI model is paired with their individual Chromebook or iPad. These devices are used throughout the day for breaks, rewards, and learning activities. The case manager or paraprofessional has the ability to monitor what the student is doing on their device in real time. They can approve access to specific apps, block distracting content, or guide the student toward calming activities like drawing, music, or educational games.

This oversight ensures that the AI model works in tandem with the adult’s judgment. For example, the AI might suggest a reward like watching a short video, but the adult can choose whether to allow it based on the student’s behavior, emotional state, or classroom context. This creates a flexible, responsive support system that blends technology with human care.
