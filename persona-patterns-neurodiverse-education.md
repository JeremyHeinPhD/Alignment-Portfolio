# Persona Patterns and the Neurodiverse Student  
*Names and identifying details have been changed to protect privacy.*

During my four years as a Special Education Paraprofessional in Washington County, Minnesota, I worked with dozens of neurodiverse students. Two of the most behaviorally complex — and most memorable — were **Monty** and **Toby**.

## Monty: The Second Grade “Teacher”

Monty was a second grader with a **Federal Setting IV (Fed 4)** designation, meaning he was eligible for a metro-area school for children with severe emotional-behavioral disorders. One teacher told me that the year before I arrived, Monty had given her a concussion. That never happened to me, but I did have to stop him from throwing rocks at the school during recess.

Despite these challenges, I found a way to connect with Monty. I promised him that at the end of each day, we could play a roleplaying game — just the two of us, in an empty classroom. Monty would sit behind the teacher’s desk and pretend to be the teacher. I sat in front of the desk and played the student. This simple reversal gave Monty a sense of control, dignity, and purpose. After about two months, Monty transitioned to the Level 4 school, but not before we had built a rapport grounded in imagination and trust.

## Toby: The Fifth Grade Restauranteur

Toby was a fifth grader who refused to attend any of his classes. I was told by a teacher that his refusal to do work had been going on for years. He spent the entire day in the **Special Education Resource Room**, and after repeatedly attacking a special education supervisor, **his mother decided to home school him**.

With Toby, I used a different kind of roleplay. At the end of each day, we went into a small, unused gym and created what he called “his restaurant.” Using frisbees, scooters, balls, and mats, Toby became the cook and server. I played the customer. This daily ritual gave him something to look forward to and helped regulate his behavior throughout the day. It was his space, his story, and his way of connecting.

## Conclusion

Max and Torin didn’t care who they pretended with — they cared that someone played the part. Whether it was a peer, me, or maybe even an AI model, what mattered was that the blueberry pie got ordered, or the math problem got solved. For them, the joy was in the persona, not the person. So when AI steps into a role with emotional consistency and social rhythm, it doesn’t need to be human — it just needs to play.

## Reflection: Persona Patterns in Practice

In AI development, **Persona Patterns** are a well-known technique for crafting prompts that simulate specific roles or perspectives. They help models reason more effectively and empathetically by anchoring responses in context and identity.

My experience with Monty and Toby suggests that Persona Patterns can also be a powerful tool for working with neurodiverse students. By allowing students to inhabit roles that give them agency, structure, and creative expression, we can foster emotional regulation, build trust, and create meaningful engagement.

**Symbolic Interaction Theory helps explain why this works.** George Herbert Mead argued that very young children learn to understand themselves and others through imitation and role-taking. When Monty played the teacher and Toby ran his restaurant, they weren’t just pretending — they were stepping into adult roles that gave them a framework for interaction. This was a form of **play therapy**: they were able to communicate well with me only when they used their imaginations to become someone else. Through these roles, they virtually became different people — confident, expressive, and socially engaged.

## Proposal: AI Roleplay for Neurodiverse Support

Could we design AI systems that play roles with neurodiverse students — as students, customers, teammates, or even fellow adventurers? Could these systems use persona-based prompting to support emotional development, social learning, and behavioral regulation?

I believe the answer is yes. And I believe my experience offers a small but meaningful blueprint for how.

## Questions I’d Like to Explore with Developers

I’m looking to collaborate with AI developers, researchers, or RLHF teams who are interested in applying large language models to support neurodiverse learners — especially through roleplay, persona-based prompting, and emotionally intelligent interaction.

These are the questions I’d like to explore together:

- How would we translate these roleplays into actual AI prompts?  
- What instructions would guide a model to simulate “student” or “customer” roles effectively?  
- How would we evaluate the AI’s responses in a neurodiverse context?  
- Could this be scaled or structured into a feedback loop?  
- What behavioral markers would indicate success or failure?  
- How do we manage safety and boundaries in role-based interactions?  
- Could this method generalize across different neurodiverse profiles?

If these questions resonate with you, I’d love to connect and explore what we can build together.
