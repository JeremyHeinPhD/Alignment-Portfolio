# Persona Patterns and Neurodiverse Students  
## Persona Patterns

In AI development, **Persona Patterns** are a well-known technique for crafting prompts that simulate specific roles or perspectives. They help models reason more effectively and empathetically by anchoring responses in context and identity.

My experiences with three special education students who I call AJ, Monty, and Toby suggests that Persona Patterns can also be a powerful tool for working with neurodiverse students. By allowing students to inhabit roles that give them agency, structure, and creative expression, we can foster emotional regulation, build trust, and create meaningful engagement.

**Symbolic Interaction Theory helps explain why this works.** George Herbert Mead argued that very young children learn to understand themselves and others through imitation and role-taking. When AJ was Dr. Einstein, when Monty played the teacher, and when Toby ran his restaurant, they weren’t just pretending — they were stepping into adult roles that gave them a framework for interaction. This was a form of **play therapy**: they were able to communicate well with me only when they used their imaginations to become someone else. Through these roles, they virtually became different people — confident, expressive, and socially engaged.

# Persona Case Studies

*Names and identifying details have been changed to protect privacy.*

During my four years as a Special Education Paraprofessional in a suburb of St Paul, I worked with dozens of neurodiverse students. Three of the most behaviorally complex — and most memorable — were all in one school in adjacent rooms: AJ, Monty, and Toby.

## AJ's Lab

AJ and I met in Ms. Carter's fifth grade classroom on the first day of the new school year. It was his
first day at the school, having just moved from Colorado, and my first day working there as a special
education paraprofessional. Although new to the school, I had already spent two years as a para at
another school. AJ was one of four students assigned to me. When I offered to hang up his jacket, he
shook my hand and said, "Thanks, bro."

As I came to learn, AJ struggled with intense anger management issues and had been labeled ADHD. A
few weeks later, his anger flared when the case manager told him he couldn't go to gym with his new
best friend Jason, another student in our resource room with severe autism. Jason rarely made friends,
and AJ was new to the school - this was his first real connection. Voices raged, doors slammed, fists
pounded doors, and the assistant principal was called.

I ended up with AJ in the Bob Cat Den, a small beige cinderblock room used when students were
"dysregulated." AJ was supposed to be in math class, so I brought his folder and handed him a
multiplication worksheet. "Dr. Einstein," I said, "you write these on the board and I'll be your assistant.
Ask me for help if you need it."

He embraced the role. With a little guidance, AJ voluntarily completed his homework. When the
assistant principal checked in, I announced, "Look, Ms. Nelson - Dr. Einstein just solved another
math problem that has stumped mathematicians for ages." AJ grinned and said, "I call it the four box
way." He had adapted my grid method for two-digit multiplication, naming it after the popular recess
game Four Square. In most classrooms this approach is called the area model, but AJ gave it his own
name - and ever since that day, I have used Four Square to explain to other students how to solve
problems like 24×39.

## Monty's Office

When I first saw the hand written sign "Monty's Office" on the door of a former closet with a large
glass panel added, I knew I wanted to work there. This was one of three "time out spaces" for special
ed students who needed a short break to calm down and it was reserved for a diminutive second grader
with a gleam in his eye and smile on his face: Monty. Unlike all other students, Monty spent almost his
whole day there.

Based on his behavior in kindergartner and first grade, the school district approved his transfer to
multi-district Fed 4 school, a specialized program designed for students with significant behavioral and
emotional needs. It cost the district $90,000 a year and there was on a long waiting list. And Monty
really needed more care than we could provide: once at recess I had to ask him not to throw rocks at
school windows.

Every day I watched his case manager and the assistant principal struggle to get him into what they
called "Monty's Office." Legally, the door could not be locked, and Monty would escape at every
opportunity, often hiding in lockers on the other side of the school. His disappearances would trigger a
search party, broadcast over our walkie-talkie system: "Wing three clear, heading to wing four." Our
greatest fear was that he had fled from the school.

Various paraprofessionals took turns sitting in Monty's Office, and when one was reassigned, I jumped
at the opportunity and volunteered to work with him for about three hours a day. We drew on the white
board with dry erasers, did some homework, he sat on the floor and at lunch while I read a story (his
favorite was a mystery series about a few kids who solve minor crimes, like a rare artifact missing from
a museum).

To elicit cooperation from our special ed students we used a reward system: at the end of the day they
could pick a favorite activity to do, but only if they had earned it. Most students chose Lego on the
floor or "tech time" on a Chromebook. Monty chose to be a math teacher - with me as his student.

At about 2:45, we would enact this role playing game - just the two of us, in an empty classroom. It
became so routine that once the assistant principal saw us walking down the hall and joked: "Heading
to Monty's new office?"

Monty would sit behind the teacher's desk and pretend to be the teacher. I sat in front of the desk and
played the student. He gave me division problems to solve and after a few seconds would bellow: "You
better finish that quick or no free time at the end of the day for you!" After I completed a problem or
two, Monty would yell: "Alright, you've earned your five minutes, I am starting the timer." In one
sense it was pure pretend-and it we both knew it. But pretending was apparently so valuable to him
that he would usually following my directions during the day. I began to wonder: was it really pretend,
or did Monty acting like a math teacher with a clip board really gave him a feeling of status, control,
and dignity? After about two months, Monty left for the Fed 4 school and the sign on the door was
taken down. But for a brief time, he really did have his own office.

## Toby's Restaurant

It was about the second week of the new school year when Toby opened his doughnut shop at his desk—an office-styled workspace with three high walls. Each day he would tape a few more pages to the outside of the walls, each showcasing a drawing and name for one of Toby’s creations. The pancake doughnut with maple syrup filling. The birthday cake doughnut with edible candle. The sandwich doughnut for those who were really hungry. Once he asked me to suggest an addition to the menu: I was delighted and recommended the “hockey puck doughnut,” recalling the black and white frosting cookies my grandmother would bake for me as a treat. Toby considered that thoughtfully for a moment, but concluded: “It won’t look like a hockey puck once I put a hole in it.”

How did Toby balance running his doughnut shop and going to class? Simple. He almost never went to class and almost never did the work we asked him to complete in our special education resource room. Once when I had coaxed him into joining the other students in the music room, he fled after a few minutes. As the other kids began strumming their guitars, the teacher sidled up to me and whispered: “Toby has gone to about three classes since kindergarten.”

Toby had severe autism: he never looked at people directly, unless he was angry, and could not read body language nor facial expression nor voice tone. He was solidly built with square shoulders and square jaw. But he really knew how to run a restaurant. At least that’s what he told me the second week of school when I invited him to go to art: "Isn’t going to happen. I'm starting a donut shop and there are going to be a lot of customers when I open up."

Despite his appealing imagination, the school principal frequently visited our special ed resource room because Toby could become aggressive toward staff and other students. Then the case manager would use the walkie-talkie system to ask for help. Once, I had to request “back up” on my walkie-talkie (our code word for aggression that had become dangerous) because the case manager was too busy staying out of range of Toby’s swinging fists.

On days when he wasn’t too disruptive, in the late afternoon Toby and I went into a small, unused space called “the old gym” and created what he called “his restaurant.” It was meant to be a reward for good behavior. This daily ritual gave him something to look forward to and helped regulate his behavior throughout the day. It was his space, his story, and his way of connecting. Using frisbees for plates and piled-up gymnastic mats for tables, we took over a corner of the space and Toby became the cook and server. I played the customer. “A slice of blueberry pie” I said each time, and Toby would scurry off to his “kitchen” only to return with a glum look: “Sorry, we’re out of that today.” Some of the other special ed students who frequented the “old gym” would often take a seat at a “table” and place an order too. “Hamburger and fries.” “Guac and chips.” Toby scurried about, with an intense, determined look on his face. He had me convinced that he really could handle what the restaurant industry calls “a fast-paced, customer service-oriented environment.”
## Conclusion

AJ, Max, and Toby didn’t care who they pretended with — they cared that someone played the part. Whether it was a peer, me, or maybe even an AI model, what mattered was that the blueberry pie got ordered, or the math problem got solved. For them, the joy was in the persona, not the person. So when AI steps into a role with emotional consistency and social rhythm, it doesn’t need to be human — it just needs to play.

## Proposal: AI Roleplay for Neurodiverse Support

Could we design AI systems that play roles with neurodiverse students — as students, customers, teammates, or even fellow adventurers? Could these systems use persona-based prompting to support emotional development, social learning, and behavioral regulation?

I believe the answer is yes. And I believe my experience offers a small but meaningful blueprint for how.

## Questions I’d Like to Explore with Developers

I’m looking to collaborate with AI developers, researchers, or RLHF teams who are interested in applying large language models to support neurodiverse learners — especially through roleplay, persona-based prompting, and emotionally intelligent interaction.

These are the questions I’d like to explore together:

- How would we translate these roleplays into actual AI prompts?  
- What instructions would guide a model to simulate “student” or “customer” roles effectively?  
- How would we evaluate the AI’s responses in a neurodiverse context?  
- Could this be scaled or structured into a feedback loop?  
- What behavioral markers would indicate success or failure?  
- How do we manage safety and boundaries in role-based interactions?  
- Could this method generalize across different neurodiverse profiles?

If these questions resonate with you, I’d love to connect and explore what we can build together.
