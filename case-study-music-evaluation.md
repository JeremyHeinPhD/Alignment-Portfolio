# Case Study: Correcting AI Misclassification of Improvised Vocal Style

**Project**: Outlier AI – Music Evaluation Project  
**Role**: AI Trainer    
**Time to Completion**: 10 minutes  
**Skills Applied**: Music genre classification, sociology of culture, ethnomusicology, critical listening, rapid analysis

## Challenge  
An AI model misclassified a music clip as R&B and flagged the vocals as being in English “and a foreign language.” The clip featured a male vocalist improvising over an electronic instrumental.

## Analysis  
- Genre Mislabeling: The instrumental clearly belonged to the Electronic genre, with subgenre characteristics of Techno and Trance — not R&B.  
- Vocal Misinterpretation: While the AI correctly identified English, it failed to recognize that the vocalist was improvising syllables and invented words, a technique rooted in jazz scat and later diffused into Reggae Ska.  
- Cultural Context: This vocal style is not “foreign” but part of a well-documented tradition of non-lexical improvisation in Black Atlantic music cultures.

## My Contribution  
- Completed a full critique in under 10 minutes: listened to the clip, reviewed the AI’s analysis, and submitted a detailed correction  
- Applied a sociology of culture framework to explain the historical and stylistic lineage of the vocal technique  
- Cited jazz scat and Reggae Ska as precedents to contextualize the improvisation and correct the AI’s cultural misreading

## Status  
Submission is pending review. Once evaluated, it may contribute to improving the model’s sensitivity to non-Western and improvisational vocal traditions.
