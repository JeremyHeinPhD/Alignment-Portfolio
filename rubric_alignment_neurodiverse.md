# PATRICK'S RUBRIC BREAKTHROUGH: AI SCALABILITY MEETS THE SIPHONOPHORE

Author’s Note  
This article proposes student-generated rubrics as a new benchmark for evaluating AI literacy tutors.  
My professional focus is on AI alignment and evaluation: designing tests that reveal reasoning gaps,  
biases, and failures in large models. I have contributed to benchmark projects with Snorkel AI, Outlier AI,  and Handshake AI, and I am currently seeking remote contract collaborations with labs and companies  interested in developing learner-centered evaluation frameworks. If your team is exploring how to  measure alignment in education or beyond, I welcome opportunities to collaborate.


## AI and Education

Rich Sutton's *Bitter Lesson* argues that the most powerful advances in AI come from general methods that scale with computation, not from human-designed, domain-specific knowledge. While this principle has driven macro-level breakthroughs in games, speech, and large language models, I use an edge case of a neurodiverse student to argue that to be successful in education, AI must include domain-specific knowledge about pedagogy — from students.

I describe working as a reading tutor with a student on the autism spectrum who was a genius but refused to use the iPad at the tutoring center where I worked. His breakthrough came not from customized tutorials on a state-of-the-art iPad, but from individualized scaffolds — rubric prompts he invented and refined with my human feedback. His case shows that in the field of reading and literacy, human-centered AI must learn to detect and scaffold learner-generated structures to align with evolving micro-level cognitive dimensions revealed by users.

## Introduction: Teaching, Tutoring, and the Limits of Technology

After retiring from 28 years as a sociology professor, I took a job as an after-school tutor at a leading center that helped struggling K-12 students improve their math, reading, and writing skills. The center used what was then a state-of-the-art iPad. Each student had customized learning modules based on assessment tests: guided practice, semi-independent work, and mastery tests. For many students, this design worked wonders.

But when I began tutoring a student I will call **Patrick Delaney**, the iPad was useless — he had severe autism and his own way of thinking. I cooperated with his unique cognitive style and in the end he learned to read. That may have been a "bitter lesson" for the iPad, but it is a revelation for AI in education.

Using Patrick as an edge case, I argue that advances in AI literacy tutoring must operate like reinforcement learning with human feedback — except here the feedback comes from the student. Each "fun fact" they ask for as well as each refusal to follow instructions is a signal. The full potential for AI education will depend on systems that can tune themselves to these micro-level feedback loops.

## Patrick's Challenges

Patrick was in a Level 4 special education setting — the most restrictive type of public school environment. His diagnosis of extreme autism meant a preoccupation with his own thoughts and resistance to talking about anything else. That is why Patrick refused to learn phonics from the iPad in our first tutoring lesson.

The tutoring center assessment stated that despite being in 4th grade, his reading ability was that of a kindergartener. His parents had been told by his school that it had done everything it could to improve his literacy.

## I Failed the Siphonophore Benchmark

On our first day, I asked Patrick what he enjoyed learning about. He said: **"animals."** When I asked him to pick one, he said: **"siphonophore."**

I thought: *Is that even a real animal?* But Patrick explained it to me: siphonophores are like jellyfish that live in very deep parts of the Pacific Ocean. They combine together from smaller, specialized individuals to form a colony. Each part is responsible for a specific task like feeding, movement, or reproduction.

## Patrick's Breakthrough

Patrick already knew a remarkable amount of facts about the real world. His recall and thoughts moved so quickly that learning to read at school and even from the iPad was deeply frustrating by comparison: a slow, mechanical process of primitive phonics lessons.

So I agreed to do what Patrick called **"research"** on animals for the first 15 minutes of our session if he would then do a lesson on the iPad. By our second lesson, I saw the pattern: he learned more about writing words from our "research" than from the iPad lessons. He particularly detested analogies like *oak is to acorn, like pine is to ...*

My breakthrough with Patrick came not through traditional instruction, but through his passion for creating what he called **"systems."** These were structured rubrics he designed to organize information about topics he loved — starting with animals. His system included categories like:

- Location  
- Diet  
- Size  
- Appearance  
- Species viability  
- Fun facts  

We started with siphonophore and ended with capybara, which I learned is the largest rodent in the world (Patrick already knew that).

## Rubric Literacy

During our lessons, I used Siri on an iPad to look up facts about each animal. Patrick was amazed at how easily we could find information online. Because he was invested in his system, he was willing to copy words into our handwritten rubric — and over time, he learned to read those words.

After dozens of animal rubrics, Patrick proposed other topics:  
- Minecraft creatures and places  
- Star Wars heroes, spaceships, weapons, and droids  
- Dragons from *How to Train Your Dragon*  
- Mario characters  

Each topic became a scaffold for literacy, research, and emotional regulation. Across more than 300 sessions, Patrick progressed from complete avoidance — including moments of dysregulation like pushing papers onto the floor — to near-grade-level reading ability.

## Conclusion: Scaling Up From 1 Patrick to Patrick + 1 Other Student

About 2 million children in the U.S. have an autism diagnosis. They are among 7.5 million special education students, each with their own Individual Education Plan. For educators, scalability means lowering the cost of individualized support so students like Patrick can learn in small groups rather than only through expensive one-on-one sessions.

Patrick’s parents spent about **$30,000** for three years of one-on-one tutoring. This underscores both the intensity of support he required and the urgent need for scalable, personalized interventions from AI education.

**Vision for AI Tutoring:**  
- Each student has individualized rubrics around their passions.  
- AI handles structured prompts and feedback loops.  
- Human tutors provide empathy and oversight.  
- Costs are reduced, accessibility increased.  

**Example Dialogue:**

While no AI education model can fully replicate the human relationship I had with Patrick, it could provide a comparable educational service at much lower cost and thus make tutoring with rubrics more accessible. In this way, scalable AI might one day resemble the siphonophore itself — many specialized parts working together seamlessly to support the whole learner.
