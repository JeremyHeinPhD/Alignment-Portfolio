When I retired from university teaching after 28 years, I became a part-time after-school tutor at a well-known tutoring center. Of the hundreds of students I worked with, one stands out: **Patrick Delaney**.

I first spoke with Patrick via Zoom. His mother — a lawyer — wanted to assess our fit as teacher and student. To make conversation, I asked Patrick if he had any brothers or sisters. He replied, “I have as many as a cyclops does eyes.” He was only nine years old, and I knew immediately we would get along well.

Despite his obvious intellect and creative way of thinking, Patrick was placed in a **Level 4 special education setting** — the most restrictive type of public school environment for students with disabilities. These schools serve children whose behavioral, emotional, or cognitive needs are so intensive that they cannot be met in mainstream or less restrictive settings. Patrick’s placement reflected the severity of his challenges: he had a diagnosis of extreme autism and a history of aggressive behavior. When I met him in 4th grade, his reading ability was assessed at a kindergarten level. His parents — both highly educated professionals — had been told by his school that they had done all they could.

It cost the school district approximately **$90,000 per year** to educate Patrick in this Level 4 setting. In addition, his parents paid the tutoring center I worked at approximately **$30,000 for private tutoring** over the course of our work together — a figure that underscores both the intensity of support required and the urgent need for scalable, personalized interventions.

Patrick’s breakthrough came not through traditional instruction, but through his passion for creating what he called “systems.” These were structured rubrics he designed to organize information about topics he loved — starting with animals. His system included categories like *location*, *diet*, *appearance*, *species viability*, and *fun facts*.

I used Siri on an iPad to look up facts about each animal. Patrick’s parents didn’t have iPhones, so he was amazed at how easily we could find information online. And because he was so invested in his system, he was willing to copy words into it — and over time, he learned to read those words.

The first animal Patrick chose for us to study together was a **siphonophore** — a deep-sea organism made up of many smaller, specialized individuals called *zooids* that function together as a single entity. Though they resemble jellyfish, siphonophores are actually colonial animals — each part responsible for a specific task like feeding, movement, or reproduction. Patrick already knew a remarkable amount about them by heart. From that first day, I knew Patrick was a genius — someone whose thoughts moved quickly and fluidly, but who was deeply frustrated by the slow, mechanical process of learning to read through phonics.

Over time, Patrick applied this rubric logic to other interests: **Minecraft**, **Star Wars**, *How to Train Your Dragon*, and more. Each topic became a scaffold for literacy, research, and emotional regulation. Across more than **300 sessions**, Patrick progressed from complete avoidance — including moments of dysregulation like throwing an iPad and breaking wooden pencils — to near-grade-level reading ability.

My role was highly structured and consistent, often resembling the kind of feedback loop an AI model might replicate. I guided his search, validated his findings, and helped him organize information — all within the framework he created. This experience mirrors the goals of **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**: aligning behavior through adaptive, empathetic, and goal-driven feedback.

Patrick’s story suggests that RLHF-informed AI tutors, trained to recognize and support learner-generated schemas, could one day provide scalable, personalized support for neurodiverse students — especially those underserved by traditional education systems. His progress was not just academic; it was a testament to the power of structured, human-centered feedback to unlock potential where others had given up.
