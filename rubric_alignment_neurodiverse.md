# PATRICK'S RUBRIC BREAKTHROUGH: AI SCALABILITY MEETS THE SIPHONOPHORE

Author’s Note  
This article proposes student-generated rubrics as a new benchmark for evaluating AI literacy tutors.  
My professional focus is on AI alignment and evaluation: designing tests that reveal reasoning gaps,  
biases, and failures in large models. I have contributed to benchmark projects with Snorkel AI, Outlier AI,  and Handshake AI, and I am currently seeking remote contract collaborations with labs and companies  interested in developing learner-centered evaluation frameworks. If your team is exploring how to  measure alignment in education or beyond, I welcome opportunities to collaborate.


# PATRICK'S RUBRIC BREAKTHROUGH: AI SCALABILITY MEETS THE SIPHONOPHORE

## AI and Education
Rich Sutton's "Bitter Lesson" argues that the most powerful advances in AI come from general methods that scale with computation, not from human-designed, domain-specific knowledge. While this principle has driven macro-level breakthroughs in games, speech, and large language models, I use an edge-case of a neurodiverse student to argue that to be successful in education, AI must include domain-specific knowledge about pedagogy—from students. 
I describe working as a reading tutor with a student on the autism spectrum who was a genius but refused to use the iPad at the tutoring center where I worked. His breakthrough came not from the customized tutorials on a state-of-the-art iPad, but from individualized scaffolds — rubric prompts he invented and refined with my human feedback. His case shows that in the field of reading and literacy, human-centered AI must learn to detect and scaffold learner-generated structures to align with evolving micro-level cognitive dimensions revealed by users.

## Teaching, Tutoring, and the Limits of Technology
When I retired after 28 years of being a sociology professor at a medium‑sized public university, I found myself pulled back into education, but from the opposite direction. I took a job as an after‑school tutor at a leading center that helped struggling K-12 students improve their math, reading, and writing skills. The center used what was then a state‑of‑the‑art iPad. Each student had customized learning modules based on assessment tests: a guided practice, semi-independent work, and a mastery test. For many students, this design worked wonders. 
But when I began tutoring a student I will call Patrick Delaney, the iPad was useless — he had severe autism and his own way of thinking. I cooperated with his unique cognitive style and in the end he learned to read. That may have been a “bitter lesson” for the iPad, but it is a revelation for AI in education. 
Using Patrick as an edge case, I argue that advances in AI literacy tutoring must operate like reinforcement learning with human feedback — except here the feedback comes from the student. Each “fun fact” they ask for as well as each refusal to follow instructions is a signal. The full potential for AI education will depend on systems that can tune themselves to these micro‑level feedback loops.
## Patrick’s Challenges
Patrick was in a Level 4 special education setting — the most restrictive type of public school environment for special education students. School districts throughout the metro area where I lived pooled their funding to support this specialized school for children whose behavioral, emotional, or cognitive needs were so intensive that they could not be met in mainstream public school. Patrick's placement there reflected the severity of his challenges. He had a diagnosis of extreme autism, which in his case meant a preoccupation with his own thoughts and resistance to talking about anything but his own thoughts. And that is why Patrick refused to learn phonics from the iPad I presented to him in our first tutoring lesson at the center. 

The tutoring center assessment of Patrick stated that despite being in 4th grade, his reading ability was that of a student in kindergarten. His parents had been told by his school that it had done everything it could to improve his literacy. 

## I Failed the Siphonophore Benchmark
On our first day at the tutoring center, I asked Patrick what he enjoyed learning about and he said “animals.”  I thought to myself—lions and tigers and bears, here we go again—but when I asked him to pick one animal and he said: “siphonophore.” I immediately had two thoughts: I don’t believe that is a real animal and then, if that is a real animal and this nine year old knows what it is, he is a genius.  
Yes, he did know what siphonophore are and he explained it to me.  As I recall, siphonophore are like jellyfish that live in very deep parts of the Pacific Ocean. They combine together from smaller, specialized individuals to form a whole or colony. Each part is responsible for a specific task like feeding, movement, or reproduction. 
## Patrick’s Breakthrough
Patrick already knew a remarkable amount of facts about the real world and that was part of his challenge, and mine. His recall and thoughts moved so quickly and fluidly that learning to read at school and even from the iPad was deeply frustrating by comparison: a slow, mechanical process of primative phonic lesson such as "the letter a has a sound like when you say apple." 
So I agreed to do what Patrick called “research” on animals for the first 15 minutes of our session if he would then do a lesson on the ipad. He agreed, but by our second lesson I could already see the pattern: he learned more about writing words from our “research” than from the highly reconstructed iPad lessons. He particularly detested lessons like: oak is to acorn, like pine is to….We made some progress on iPad lessons about folklore where interpretation of setting and conflict where being asked. But the more structured the iPad lessons, the more he refused to do them. 
My breakthrough with Patrick came not through traditional instruction, but through his passion for creating what he called "systems." These were structured rubrics he designed to organize information about topics he loved — starting with animals. His system included categories like location, diet, size, appearance, species viability, and fun facts. We started with siphonophore and as I recall ended with the capabara, which I learned is the largest rodent in the world (Patrick already knew that).

## Rubric Literacy
During our lessons, I used Siri on an iPad to look up facts about each animal. This was still a novelty for Patrick because Chatbots didn’t exist yet and Patrick's parents didn't have iPhones. He was amazed at how easily we could find information online and wanted to see the results but would add “you read it.” Of course, I did read the results at first but slowly got him to take a peak. And because he was so invested in his system, he was willing to copy words into our handwritten rubric — and over time, he learned to read those words.

After creating rubrics on dozens of animals, Patrick proposed other topics and created other rubrics. Over many months we slogged our way through Minecraft creatures and places. Then it was on to Star Wars heroes, space ships, weapons, and droids. I recall numerous rubrics on creates from the genre How to Train Your Dragon, including a dragon with two heads: one to spew a flamable substance while another head spat out sparks to complete the combustion. And of course there was Mario (the video game character). Each topic became a scaffold for literacy, research, and emotional regulation. Across more than 300 sessions, Patrick progressed from complete avoidance — including moments of dysregulation like pushing our papers onto the floor — to near-grade-level reading ability.

## Conclusion: Scaling Up From 1 Patrick to Patrick + 1 Other Student
About 2 million children in the U.S. have an autism diagnosis. They are among 7.5 million special education students in public and private US schools, each with their own Individual Education Plan, mandated by federal and state law. So Sutton’s notion of brute‑force scalability resonates in education, though for teachers, paraprofessionals, and tutors it is less about billions of parameters and more about access. For educators, scalability means lowering the cost of individualized support so that students like Patrick can learn in small groups rather than only through expensive one‑on‑one sessions.
When Patrick's parents — both highly educated professionals — refused to accept his school's conclusion that nothing more could be done to improve his reading skills, they paid the tutoring about $100 for a 50-minute private lesson so I could try to teach Patrick to read. I estimate that his parents spent a total of $30,000 for our one-on-one tutoring over the three years I tutored him at the center. This cost underscores both the intensity of support he required and the urgent need for scalable, personalized interventions from AI education so more students can afford can the breakthrough that Patrick did.
AI education that personalizes instruction would also enable me to tutor more than one student at a time. I can easily imagine that AI in the iPad I used would allow me to tutor two or more students at the same time. Each student would have individualized rubrics around their passions, with a common literacy focus. AI would handle structured prompts and feedback loops, while I provided empathy and oversight. Outside of class, I could review their rubric work and make personalized revisions, ensuring each learner’s journey stayed authentic. This hybrid model would dramatically reduce costs and increase accessibility, making individualized tutoring scalable for neurodiverse learners. For example,

> AI: What do you like learning about?
> Student: Football.
> AI: Do you have a favorite team?
> Student: The Philadelphia Eagles.
> AI: Great—let’s explore. Do you want to learn about the team’s history or the city itself?
> Student: I already know the history. Where’s Philly?
> AI: Philadelphia is in Pennsylvania. It’s close to other cities with NFL teams, like the New York Giants, the Washington Commanders, and the Baltimore Ravens. I’ll write a fun fact about each team for you to read.
> Student: Okay, let’s do that, but it better be funny!
