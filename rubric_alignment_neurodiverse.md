> **Rubric-Based Alignment for a Neurodiverse Learner** 

---

When I retired from university teaching after 28 years, I became a part-time after-school tutor at a well-known tutoring center. I tutored hundreds students over my five years of work (2018-2023) but **Patrick Delaney** had the biggest impact one me because of what he taught me about the learning process of neurodiverse students.

I first spoke with Patrick via Zoom. His mother wanted to assess our fit as teacher and student. To make conversation, I asked Patrick if he had any brothers or sisters. He was anoyed by his Mom's suggestion that he needed a tutor and gavee me a surly reply: “I have as many as a cyclops does eyes.” He was only nine years old, and I knew immediately we would get along well.

Despite his obvious intellect and creative way of thinking, Patrick was in a **Level 4 special education setting** — the most restrictive type of public school environment for students with disabilities. This specialized school served children whose behavioral, emotional, or cognitive needs were so intensive that they could not be met in mainstream public school. Patrick’s placement there reflected the severity of his challenges. He had a diagnosis of extreme autism, which in his case meantn an extreme preoccupation with his thoughts and resistance to talking about anything but his own thoughts. He also had a history of aggressive behavior, which I first witnessed when he three an ipad in my direction, brusing my wrist. 

When I met Patrick at the tutoring center for the firs time he was in 4th grade with a reading ability assessed at a kindergarten level. His parents — both highly educated professionals — had been told by his school that it couldn't do any more. It cost the school district approximately **$90,000 per year** to educate Patrick in this Level 4 setting. In addition, his parents paid the tutoring center I worked at about $100 for a 50 minute session and I estimate that his parents spent a total of **$30,000 for our one-on-one tutoring** over the three years I tutored him at the center (I continued tutoring him privately after his parents decided to use this money for therapy sessions for Patrick). The fact that a single year of school and out of school tutoring for Patrick cost about **$100,000** underscores both the intensity of support he required and the urgent need for scalable, personalized interventions from AI education so more students can achieve the breakthrought that Patrick did. 

Patrick’s breakthrough came not through traditional instruction, but through his passion for creating what he called “systems.” These were structured rubrics he designed to organize information about topics he loved — starting with animals. His system included categories like *location*, *diet*, *size*, *appearance*, *species viability*, and *fun facts*.

I used Siri on an iPad to look up facts about each animal. Patrick’s parents didn’t have iPhones, so he was amazed at how easily we could find information online. And because he was so invested in his system, he was willing to copy words into it — and over time, he learned to read those words.

The first animal Patrick chose for us to study together was a **siphonophore** — a deep-sea organism made up of many smaller, specialized individuals called *zooids* that function together as a single entity. Though they resemble jellyfish, siphonophores are actually colonial animals — each part responsible for a specific task like feeding, movement, or reproduction. Patrick already knew a remarkable amount about them by heart. From that first day, I knew Patrick was a genius — someone whose thoughts moved quickly and fluidly, but who was deeply frustrated by the slow, mechanical process of learning to read through phonics.

Over time, Patrick applied this rubric logic to other interests: **Minecraft**, **Star Wars**, *How to Train Your Dragon*, and more. Each topic became a scaffold for literacy, research, and emotional regulation. Across more than **300 sessions**, Patrick progressed from complete avoidance — including moments of dysregulation like throwing an iPad and snapping wooden pencils — to near-grade-level reading ability.

My role was highly structured and consistent, often resembling the kind of feedback loop an AI model might replicate. I guided his search, validated his findings, and helped him organize information — all within the framework he created. This experience mirrors the goals of **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**: aligning behavior through adaptive, empathetic, and goal-driven feedback.

Patrick’s story suggests that RLHF-informed AI tutors, trained to recognize and support learner-generated schemas, could one day provide scalable, personalized support for neurodiverse students — especially those underserved by traditional education systems. His progress was not just academic; it was a testament to the power of structured, human-centered feedback to unlock potential where others had given up.
