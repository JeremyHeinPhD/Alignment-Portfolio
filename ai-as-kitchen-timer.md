# Can AI Be a Timer? Then It Can Help a Teacher

When I worked as a special education paraprofessional, I carried a little kitchen timer wherever I went. I could not have done my job without it. Numerous times during the day, I’d ask my students, “Do you want a two, three, or four-minute break?” These little breaks were a lot more than free time: they gave students a role in the decision and planning process. For many of my students, emotional regulation meant remembering that it was possible to ignore impulses and follow a plan. This approach is known as nonpreferred/preferred in special education — pairing a required task with a motivating activity to support transitions.

In this context, the timer wasn’t just a countdown — it was a promise. If I said, “You can take a three-minute break, and then we’ll start math,” they knew I meant it. And when the timer beeped, they knew what was coming next — we would get back to work. Of course, the students would often ask for a lot more time — five minutes, ten minutes, even longer. But that proved they were engaging with me. They accepted me, and they accepted the timer as part of their learning process. It became a shared tool, not just a rule. More importantly, it helped them reconnect — not just to the task, but to me. They were able to tune out the internal noise — the overwhelming sounds and images in their minds — because they had reconnected to a real person who was present, consistent, and calm.

Because my work in special education had to be broken into tiny (atomic), precise, self-contained, repeatable steps (mandatory and optional), I know rubrics can help teachers like me — and AI can help build them.
