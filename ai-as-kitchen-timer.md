# Can AI Be a Timer? Then It Can Help a Teacher

When I worked as a special education paraprofessional, I carried a little kitchen timer wherever I went. I could not have done my job without it. Numerous times during the day, I’d ask my students, “Do you want a two, three, or four-minute break?” These little breaks were a lot more than free time: they gave students a role in the decision and planning process. For many of my students, emotional regulation meant remembering that it was possible to ignore impulses and follow a plan. This approach is known as nonpreferred/preferred in special education — pairing a required task with a motivating activity to support transitions.

In this context, the timer wasn’t just a countdown — it was a promise. If I said, “You can take a three-minute break, and then we’ll start math,” they knew I meant it. And when the timer beeped, they knew what was coming next — we would get back to work. Of course, the students would often ask for a lot more time — five minutes, ten minutes, even longer. But that proved they were engaging with me. They accepted me, and they accepted the timer as part of their learning process. It became a shared tool, not just a rule. More importantly, it helped them reconnect — not just to the task, but to me. They were able to tune out the internal noise — the overwhelming sounds and images in their minds — because they had reconnected to a real person who was present, consistent, and calm.

I got student cooperation through an extremely small set of phrases delivered at the right time — knowing when to ask the question about taking a break and how to respond when students didn’t follow the expected script. My phrases were so short and predictable that students soon learned what I would say and when I would say it. It was only after I started working in AI that I realized I had created a rubric: a structured set of atomic, repeatable steps that helped students succeed.

## Implications for Human-Centered AI

My classroom practice showed me that consistency and timing mattered more than emotional language. AI responses that are consistent and aligned with promoting positive outcomes are more important than humanistic word choice in educational settings. Human-centered AI should be designed the same way: strategic, tactical, and aligned with positive outcomes.



AI can extend this approach far beyond one classroom. It can help teachers build rubrics that scaffold learning, support transitions, and provide patient communication for students who need it most. Human-centered AI is not about simulating feelings; it is about delivering the right response at the right time. In this way, AI can play a much bigger role in education — not just for the smartest students, but for those who need the most patience and communication skills from teachers.
