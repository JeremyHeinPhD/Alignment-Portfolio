Neurodiverse students include those on the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or with emototional-behavioral disorders.
Autism is a communication disorder, usually exhibited as an inability to engage in spontanious, turning-take speech with another person. In extreme cases, a student with autism will engage in "scripting."
Scripting means repeating a phrase over and over, such as the same line of a song or a line from a TV commercial. It is an obsessive behavior and the student will react with hostility if interupted.
An emotional-behaviorial disorder is often characterized by extremes of sadness or anger; the student has difficulty maintaining a middle-ground emotional state.
When sad, the student will curl up on the floor and may ask "I am a bad person." When angry, the student may engage in physical agression and yelling. 
I worked as a speical education paraprofessional with this student population in elementary schools in Washington County, MN, for four years
I learned many techniques for helping students when they became "disregulated." 
Disregulated means the student has started a negative emotional loop and is unable to realistically interpret the impact of their emotions and behaivor on others.
Examples of disregulation include: pushing assigned work of off their desk and onto the floor; breaking a pencil as a sign of refusal to work; leaving the classroom without persmission.
One of the most well know techniques for helping a student become "regulated" is called Handling Big Emotions. 
This technique uses a five step script and an AI model could easily do this just like a paraprofessional. Here is the rubric.
Step 1: Say "It seems like you are feeling upset."
Step 2: Say "Are you feeling sad/angry/frustrated/scared [choose appropriate big emotion]."
Step 3: Say: "Are you feeling frustrated because...[provide realistic exaplantion, such as 'there is too much work']"
Step 4: Say: "Would you feel less frustrated if I crossed off some of the questions so you only have to do one question now?"
Step 5: Say: "What else can I do to help you feel less frustrated?"
Many neurodiverse students wear noise cancelling headphones and an AI model in a headphone could say these lines to a student, as well as respond appropriately.
