# AI and Neurodiverse Students

Neurodiverse students include those on the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or with emotional-behavioral disorders.

Autism is a communication disorder, usually exhibited as an inability to engage in spontaneous, turn-taking speech with another person.

In extreme cases, a student with autism may engage in **scripting** — repeating a phrase over and over, such as a line from a song or a TV commercial.

This behavior is obsessive, and the student may react with hostility if interrupted.

An emotional-behavioral disorder is often characterized by extremes of sadness or anger.

The student has difficulty maintaining a middle-ground emotional state.

When sad, the student may curl up on the floor and ask, _“Am I a bad person?”_

When angry, the student may engage in physical aggression and yelling.

I worked as a special education paraprofessional with this student population in elementary schools in Washington County, MN, for four years.

I learned many techniques for helping students when they became **dysregulated** — caught in a negative emotional loop 
and unable to realistically interpret the impact of their emotions and behavior.

Examples of dysregulation include pushing assigned work off the desk, breaking a pencil as a sign of refusal, or leaving the classroom without permission.

One well-known technique for helping a student become regulated is called **Handling Big Emotions**.

It uses a five-step script that an AI model could easily follow, just like a paraprofessional:

1. _“It seems like you are feeling upset.”_

2. _“Are you feeling sad/angry/frustrated/scared?”_

3. _“Are you feeling frustrated because… [e.g., ‘there is too much work’]”_

4. _“Would you feel less frustrated if I crossed off some questions so you only have to do one?”_

5. _“What else can I do to help you feel less frustrated?”_

Many neurodiverse students wear noise-canceling headphones.

An AI model embedded in headphones could deliver this script and respond appropriately.
